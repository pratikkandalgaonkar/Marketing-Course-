#Marketing to Potential caravan Policy Buyers

Problem Statement - 
Direct mailings to a company’s potential customers – “junk mail” to many – can effectively market a product or a 
service. However, as we all know, much of this junk mail is really of no interest to the people that receive it. Most of it ends up thrown
away, not only wasting the money that the company spent on it but also filling up landfill waste sites or needing to be recycled.
If the company has a better understanding of who their potential customers are, they would know more accurately who to send it to, 
so some of this waste and expense could be reduced.

1.  predicted whether a customer is interested #in a caravan insurance policy from other data about the customer.

2.  Information about customers consists of #86 variables and includes product usage data and socio-demographic data derived from zip-area 
codes.

3.  We performed data preprocessing by cleaning our data variables and checked #for any Null values in our table, and then out of 86 variables
we separated our target variable and input variables and created dummies #for variables that were categorical in nature

4.  Used a Logistic Regression Model #for analysis as it satisfied Regression assumptions like Linearity, lower Endogeneity of regressors,
Normality and Homoscedasticity, No autocorrelation and no multicollinearity

5. Used GridSearchCV to check which parameters would fit best the parameters passed were l1 and l2 normalization penalties, 
Inverse regularization parameter, and we use class_weight to balance out our imbalanced data as one side being favored over other
will skew the results #in the direction of the majority values as they are higher in number

6.  We calculated our cutoff score using f-beta score
